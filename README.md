## Choose wanted types of episodes

In `anime.py` or `mangas.py`, modify the global variable `interests` to only contain the types of episodes you are interested in.

## Setup environment, e.g. install dependencies

```sh
uv sync
```

## Get episodes of interest

```sh
uv run anime.py
# or
uv run mangas.py
```
